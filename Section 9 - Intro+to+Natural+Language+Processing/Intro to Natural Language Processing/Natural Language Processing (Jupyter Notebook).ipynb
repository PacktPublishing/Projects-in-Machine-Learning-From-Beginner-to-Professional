    "Stemming, which attempts to normalize sentences, is another preprocessing step that we can perform.  In the english language, different variations of words and sentences often having the same meaning.  Stemming is a way to account for these variations; furthermore, it will help us shorten the sentences and shorten our lookup.  For example, consider the following sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I was taking a ride on my horse.\n",
    "* I was riding my horse.\n",

    "These sentences mean the same thing, as noted by the same tense (-ing) in each sentence; however, that isn't intuitively understood by the computer. To account for all the variations of words in the english language, we can use the Porter stemmer, which has been around since 1979."
